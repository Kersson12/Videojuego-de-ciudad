# Futurecity

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase for a Godot Engine project, likely a game, centered around a city. While a detailed description isn't available, the project structure and file names suggest elements such as a memory game and interactive nodes.  Further details on the game's mechanics and story are within the source code and project documentation.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Godot Engine:** Built using Godot Engine, benefiting from its flexibility, scene-based structure, and GDScript scripting language.
*   **Memory Game Integration:** Includes a memory game component (`memory_game.gd`), potentially integrated within the city environment.
*   **Node-Based Design:** Leverages Godot's node system for creating interactive elements and scenes.
*   **Modular Structure:** Source code, documentation, and other assets are organized into separate directories.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Godot Engine (v3.x or v4.x):**  The project requires Godot Engine to run and be edited.  Download the appropriate version from [https://godotengine.org/download/](https://godotengine.org/download/).
*   **GDScript Knowledge:** Familiarity with GDScript is essential for understanding and modifying the code.
*   **Text Editor or IDE:** A suitable text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code with GDScript support) for editing the scripts.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kersson12/Videojuego-de-ciudad.git
    cd Videojuego-de-ciudad
    ```

2.  **Open in Godot Engine:**
    *   Launch Godot Engine.
    *   Click "Import" and select the root directory of the cloned repository (`Videojuego-de-ciudad`).
    *   Configure the project settings as needed (e.g., rendering settings).

3.  **Run the Project:**
    *   In the Godot Editor, open the main scene (`main.tscn` or `node_2d.tscn`).
    *   Click the "Play" button to run the game.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Detailed API documentation isn't provided directly in the repository. Refer to the inline comments within the GDScript files (`.gd`) for usage examples.

**Example (GDScript - main.gd):**

```gdscript
extends Node

# Example signal connection
signal game_over

func _ready():
	print("Game Started!")

func end_game():
    emit_signal("game_over")
    print("Game Over!")
```

To understand the interaction of different scenes and scripts, review the connections in the Godot Editor.

## Configuration Options

The project may have configurable settings within the Godot Editor:

*   **Project Settings:** Accessible through "Project > Project Settings." This allows you to modify resolution, input mappings, rendering settings, and more.
*   **Node Properties:** Each node in the Godot scene has properties that can be adjusted in the Inspector panel. These properties control the node's behavior and appearance.
*   **Environment Variables:** The project might leverage environment variables to adjust behaviour in different deployment settings, though there's no explicit mention of it in the files. These would be set through the OS or through Godot's custom settings.

## Contributing Guidelines

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a branch for your contribution:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
3.  **Make Changes:** Implement your changes or additions.  Follow best practices for clean, well-commented code.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add: Your feature description"
    ```
5.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.
7.  **Code Review:** Await code review and address any feedback.
